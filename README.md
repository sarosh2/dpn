# Sarosh's Perceptron Networks (SPNs)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the **Sarosh's Perceptron Networks (SPNs)** project, a neural network framework that aims to improve the connectivity and flexibility of neurons in a perceptron network. SPNs remove the typical constraints on neuron connections to form directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing for richer feature learning with reduced space and time complexities.

The framework introduces several approaches to optimize SPNs, including **Object-based Representation**, **Sequential Representation**, and **Block-based Representation**, each with varying complexity and trade-offs.

## Key Features

- **Denser Connectivity**: Allows neurons to form unrestricted connections.
- **Optimized Time and Space Complexity**: Various approaches to improve efficiency, from **Maximal SPNs** to **Minimal SPNs** and **Pruning Techniques**.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology, approaches, and results, please refer to the project report available in PDF format:
