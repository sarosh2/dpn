# Denser Perceptron Networks (DPNs)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the **Denser Perceptron Networks (DPNs)** project, a neural network framework that aims to improve the connectivity and flexibility of neurons in a perceptron network. DPNs remove the typical constraints on neuron connections to form directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing for richer feature learning with reduced space and time complexities.

The framework introduces several approaches to optimize DPNs, including **Object-based Representation**, **Sequential Representation**, and **Block-based Representation**, each with varying complexity and trade-offs.

## Key Features

- **Denser Connectivity**: Allows neurons to form unrestricted connections.
- **Optimized Time and Space Complexity**: Various approaches to improve efficiency, from **Maximal DPNs** to **Minimal DPNs** and **Pruning Techniques**.
